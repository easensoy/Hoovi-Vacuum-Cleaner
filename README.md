### Successor function
The successor function is a unary function that takes a number as input and returns the next number in the sequence.

Here, successor function denoted as S, while the number is n. S(n) gives the next number in the sequence after n.

S(0) = 1 <br />
S(1) = 2 <br />
S(2) = 3 <br />
S(3) = 4 <br />
S(4) = 5

The successor function is a key building block in the Peano axioms, which provide an axiomatization of the natural numbers.
