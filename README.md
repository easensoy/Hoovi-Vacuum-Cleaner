### Successor function
The successor function is a unary function that takes a number as input and returns the next number in the sequence.

Here, successor function denoted as S, while the number is n. S(n) gives the next number in the sequence after n.

S(0) = 1 <br />
S(1) = 2 <br />
S(2) = 3 <br />
S(3) = 4 <br />
S(4) = 5

The successor function is a key building block in the Peano axioms, which provide an axiomatisation of the natural numbers. 
## HOOVI - The intelligent agent
HOOVI is an agent. So, how can this agent be rational?

- [x] We need to tell the agent what is rational, i.e. it needs a performance measure

- [x] The agent stores a percept sequence (information about environmental states)

- [x] The agent may have some prior knowledge of the environment

- [x] There are well-defined actions that can be performed by the agent

Definition of a rational agent

- [x] For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximise the performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.

A percept sequence refers to the sequence of perceptual inputs that an agent receives from its environment. Percepts are the raw sensory inputs, such as visual or auditory data, that the agent uses to perceive and understand its environment. The agent's decision-making and behavior are often based on the current and past percept sequences it has encountered.
